# The self-referential digit crux is exactly the √2 / base-2 phenomenon

**Context.** The headline Graham–Pollak result rests on `Erdos482.crux`: the *self-referential*
inequality `0 ≤ {x} − √2·{x/2} + √2/2 < 1`, where the recurrence's own coefficient `√2` equals the
algebraic generator of the number whose digits it reads.  A natural question (cf.
`notes/CUBIC-EXPLORATION.md`): does this self-reference generalize to other bases `g` — i.e. does
`u ↦ ⌊√g·(u + c)⌋` read base-`g` digits, via a `g`-analogue crux

> `0 ≤ {x} − √g·{x/g} + c·√g < 1`   for all `x`?

**Answer: NO for every `g ≥ 3`, for ANY offset `c`** (`selfref_crux_fails_of_three_le`).  Combined
with `Erdos482.crux` (the `g = 2`, `c = ½` case) this pins the phenomenon down completely: the elegant
self-referential digit extraction exists **iff `g = 2`** — it is a genuinely quadratic, base-2
miracle, not the tip of a tower of base-`g` analogues.  (Stoll's general St05/St06 results read *any*
real's base-`g` digits, but with a `w`-tuned rational coefficient, never the self-referential `√g`.)

**Proof idea.**  Two witnesses pin `c` between incompatible bounds when `g ≥ 3`:
* `x = g − 1`  has `{x} = 0`, `{x/g} = (g−1)/g`, so the lower bound forces `c·√g ≥ √g·(g−1)/g`,
  i.e. `c ≥ (g−1)/g`;
* `x = ½`  has `{x} = ½`, `{x/g} = 1/(2g)`, so the upper bound needs `½ − √g/(2g) + c·√g < 1`.
Substituting `c ≥ (g−1)/g` and `√g·√g = g` reduces the two to `2g − √g − 3 < 0`, which is false for
`g ≥ 3` (there `√g < g`, so `2g − √g − 3 > g − 3 ≥ 0`).  No `c` survives.

/-- **The self-referential crux fails for every base `g ≥ 3`.**  For each integer `g ≥ 3` and each
offset `c`, there is a real `x` for which the `g`-analogue crux
`0 ≤ {x} − √g·{x/g} + c·√g < 1` is violated.  So no `u ↦ ⌊√g·(u + c)⌋` recurrence can read base-`g`
digits the way `⌊√2·(u + ½)⌋` reads base-2 digits.  (`g = 2`, `c = ½` is `Erdos482.crux`.) -/

/-- **Characterization: the self-referential digit crux is solvable iff the base is 2.**  For an
integer base `g ≥ 2`, there exists an offset `c` making `0 ≤ {x} − √g·{x/g} + c·√g < 1` hold for
**all** `x` **iff `g = 2`** (and then `c = ½` works, by `Erdos482.crux`).  This is the exact sense in
which Graham–Pollak's `⌊√2·(u + ½)⌋` digit recurrence is a one-off: no base `g ≥ 3` admits the
analogous self-referential extractor. -/
